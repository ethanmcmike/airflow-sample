# Unit Test Samples

## Arrival Gate Manager
This class is used in the flight spawning process to simulates enroute spacing by tracking times that arrivals enter the terminal airspace.
It has a few simple methods for getting/setting gate times and coordinates and also an update method for removing expired gates.
The tests check basic functionality and also a few specific situations for expiring and overlapping gates.
